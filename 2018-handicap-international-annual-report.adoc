== Staying the course in an increasingly turbulent world

Changes to France’s tax laws caused an unprecedented decline in HI’s private donations in 2018.
However, this contextual issue must not be allowed to overshadow the benefits achieved from the profound transformations made to our organisation during the course  of the year.
Meanwhile, in an ever more complex world, we continued to deliver adapted responses to humanitarian crises,
including in countries such as Libya and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
left to fend for themselves by the international community.
Our steadfast determination not to abandon the victims of invisible crises is integral to HI’s DNA.
